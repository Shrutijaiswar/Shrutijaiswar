Hi, I’m Shruti Jaiswar

I’m an undergraduate student at DTU with a passion for software development, AI, and building smart, responsive applications. I enjoy exploring new technologies, experimenting with AI integration, and developing recommendation systems.

🌱 Currently learning full-stack development, AI integration, and modern web technologies.

💞️ Open to collaborating on student projects, internships, and open-source initiatives.
